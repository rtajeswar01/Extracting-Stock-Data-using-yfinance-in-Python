# Extracting-Stock-Data-using-yfinance-in-Python

Extracting stock data in Python involves utilizing libraries such as yfinance or pandas_datareader to retrieve historical and real-time stock information from various sources, including financial APIs and websites. These libraries provide functions to specify the stock symbol or ticker, along with parameters like the desired time period, frequency, or specific data points required. The extracted stock data is typically stored in a pandas DataFrame, allowing for easy manipulation, analysis, and visualization of the data. Common data points include the stock's opening and closing prices, high and low prices, trading volume, and adjusted close. By leveraging these Python libraries, developers and analysts can access and analyze stock data for tasks such as backtesting trading strategies, financial modeling, and decision-making in the investment domain.
